## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

You must have the following installed on your machine:

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
  * **Apache Maven**
  * **MySQL Server** running locally (default port 3306 is assumed).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/hotel-booking-system-java.git
cd hotel-booking-system-java
```

### Step 2: Database Setup

1.  **Create Database:** Log into your MySQL client (Workbench or CLI) and create the database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE hotel_booking_system;
    ```
2.  **Execute Schema Script:** Load the setup script to create tables and insert initial data.
      * Find the script at: `src/main/resources/schema.sql`
      * Execute all commands in this file against the `hotel_booking_system` database.

### Step 3: Configure Credentials

Update the connection settings in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```properties
# Replace with your actual MySQL credentials
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=praveen@1322?
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Execute the Maven command from the project root directory:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

$$\text{http://localhost:8080/}$$

## üîë Default Credentials for Testing

| Role | Username | Password | Notes |
